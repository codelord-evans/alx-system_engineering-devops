# ALX Postmortem Web-Stack Project

The ALX Postmortem Web-Stack project is a web-based application developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It serves as a platform for conducting postmortems, allowing teams to collaboratively analyze and document incidents, and to learn from them for future improvements.

## Features

- **Incident Logging**: Users can create and log incidents, providing details such as date, time, severity, affected systems, and a description of the incident.
- **Collaborative Analysis**: Team members can collaborate on incident analysis, share their observations, and discuss the root causes and contributing factors.
- **Document Attachments**: Users can attach relevant files, such as log files, screenshots, or incident reports, to incidents for reference and analysis.
- **Timeline View**: The application provides a timeline view, allowing users to visualize incidents chronologically and identify patterns or trends.
- **Metrics and Reporting**: ALX Postmortem Web-Stack offers metrics and reporting capabilities, enabling users to generate reports on incident frequency, duration, and other relevant statistics.
- **Notification System**: Users can receive notifications about incidents, comments, or updates to stay informed and engaged.
- **User Management**: The system supports user roles and permissions, allowing administrators to manage access and control user privileges.

## Technologies Used

The ALX Postmortem Web-Stack project is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like React or Angular are used for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: The backend is built using a server-side framework like Node.js or Django, which provides the necessary APIs and handles the business logic.
- **Database**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite is used to store incident data, user information, and other relevant data.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Authentication and authorization are implemented using technologies like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth, or session-based authentication to ensure secure access to the application.
- **Real-time Communication**: Technologies like WebSocket or Socket.io may be utilized for real-time communication and updates between team members.
- **Deployment**: The application can be deployed on a cloud platform like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Heroku for accessibility and scalability.

## Installation and Setup

To run the ALX Postmortem Web-Stack project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-postmortem-web-stack.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd alx-postmortem-web-stack`
3. Install the required dependencies:
   - If using Node.js: Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - If using Python: Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies using `pip` or a package manager like `pipenv` or `poetry`.
4. Configure the backend:
   - Set up the database connection and credentials.
   - Configure authentication and authorization settings.
   - Set other necessary environment variables (e.g., SMTP server details for email notifications).
5. Configure the frontend:
   - Update API endpoint URLs to point to your locally running backend.
   - Set any other environment-specific configurations.
6. Build the frontend:
   - If using React: Run `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
   - If using Angular: Run `ng build`.
7. Start the backend server: Run the appropriate command for your backend framework (e.g., `npm start`, `node server.js`, `python manage.py runserver`).
8. Access the application in your web browser: Open `http://localhost:

3000` or the URL specified by your backend server.
